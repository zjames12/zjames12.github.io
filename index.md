Hi! I'm a PhD student at Cornell University using statistics and data science to solve problems in the environmental sciences and public health. I currently work with [Joe Guinness](https://guinness.cals.cornell.edu/) to develop efficient algorithms for spatial statistics. My previous work includes working with ecologists to model tree growth in the Amazon rainforest, preprocessing data to help epidemiologists study spillover events, and using large data sets to give public health experts a better understanding of addiction.

I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech.
